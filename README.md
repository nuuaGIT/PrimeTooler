## Features

### Slot Locking
Allows players to lock individual inventory slots.  
Locked slots prevent items from being moved, dropped, or replaced unintentionally, helping to keep important tools and items in fixed positions.

### Durability Guard
Protects tools and armor from breaking due to accidental overuse:
- Prevents usage when an item reaches a critical durability threshold
- Optional warnings before durability becomes critical
- Helps preserve valuable or rare equipment

### Additional Quality of Life Features
PrimeTooler is designed to be modular and extensible.  
Further Quality of Life features may be added over time, with a focus on usability and player convenience.
